      <p className="aboutUs-description">
        FOBANA®, is a non-profit, non-political and non-discriminatory, IRS
        501c(3) tax-exempt (Tax ID 26-1747615) organization, established 1987.
        Only qualified Bangladeshi Associations in North America can be the
        members of FOBANA. One of the most important goal of this organization
        is to preserve and promote the language, culture and heritage of
        Bangladesh. This organization of Bangladeshi Associations in North
        America has been recognized as an umbrella, where all the Bangladeshis
        living in North America can gather to celebrate their successes and
        deliver cultural talents through stage performances. Since its inception
        in 1987, FOBANA® has been working tirelessly in this land far away from
        our ancestral homeland to keep our indigenous culture and commence it to
        our next generation growing in North America, primarily.
      </p>
      <p className="aboutUs-description">
        In addition, FOBANA® has recently received appreciation for its work to
        assimilate our people with the mainstream of North American people and
        culture. Those of us who are working in spite of all obstacles in
        different communities all over the continent are getting recognition
        from this organization. In other words, FOBANA® is a symbol of our hope
        and aspiration and a unifying force for bringing our communities
        together and for moving it in forward direction.
